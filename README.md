## ðŸš€ Projects

### [Project 1: Customer Churn Predictor](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Customer-Churn-Predictor)
A Flask-based web application for predicting customer churn in a telecom company. This project uses machine learning models to determine whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features.

### [Project 2: loan-Approval-System](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/loan-Approval-System)
This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts loan approval based on applicant details such as income, education level, credit history, and other factors.


### [Project 3: Gemstone-Price-Prediction-With-Mlops-Pipeline](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Gemstone-Price-Prediction-With-Mlops-Pipeline) 
This project focuses on predicting gemstone prices using a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, integrated with MLOps practices to ensure smooth deployment and scaling. The model is deployed on Render and can predict the price of gemstones based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.



## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

I'm currently diving deeper into **Deep Learning** and exploring **Generative AI** models. I'm also working on enhancing my skills in **Web Development**.
