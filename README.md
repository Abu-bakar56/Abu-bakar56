Analyze and visualize your WhatsApp chat history with this interactive web app built using Streamlit. The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer provides a detailed breakdown of chat data, including message frequency, word count, media sharing, and more. The app offers both overall and user-specific analyses, along with a range of visualizations.

### [Project 7: Customer Churn Predictor](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Customer-Churn-Predictor)
A Flask-based web application for predicting customer churn in a telecom company. This project uses machine learning models to determine whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features.

### [Project 8: loan-Approval-System](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/loan-Approval-System)
This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts loan approval based on applicant details such as income, education level, credit history, and other factors.

### [Project 9: Gemstone-Price-Prediction-With-Mlops-Pipeline](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Gemstone-Price-Prediction-With-Mlops-Pipeline) 
This project focuses on predicting gemstone prices using a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, integrated with MLOps practices to ensure smooth deployment and scaling. The model is deployed on Render and can predict the price of gemstones based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

### [Project 10: Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM) 
This project predicts and forecasts stock closing prices for 30 future days using a Stacked LSTM model. It processes time-series data, captures temporal dependencies, and visualizes historical vs. predicted trends for financial insights.

### [Project 11: Extract-data-Bank-Statement-Fastapi](https://github.com/Abu-bakar56/Bank-Statement-Fast-api)
